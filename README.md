# NOTES APP 
This is a notes app that has been created in react html and css. It is a practice exercise. 

## Concepts Learnt 
In the course of using the project, I learnt the use of: 
1. React hooks such as useState and useEffect. 
1. Use of localstorage in react to store my notes array and retrieved previously stored notes. 

## Challenges faced 
The main challenge that I experienced while creating this project was the use of state with local storage. 
I am able to set state on every change such as a deleted note, however, when on updating the local storage, I either get a complete reset of the entire notes array, thereby loosing the localstorage copy or I remain with one note that sticks after deleting every other note.
